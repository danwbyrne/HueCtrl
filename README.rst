Hue Ctrl
========

HueCtrl is a program that creates ambient lighting using Phillip Hue LED bulbs along with a Hue API and screen monitoring. This is a refactoring of an old project I created in python 2.7.x. The main goals here are to increase screen capturing speed and create a more fluid up to date code that is easier to use.

.. code:: bash

	pipenv install
	pipenv run python src\main.py
